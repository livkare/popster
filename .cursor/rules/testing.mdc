### Code Review and Testing Workflow
IMPORTANT: when asked to test with playwrite i do **not** mean to run the tests, I mean for you to use playwrite mpc to click around!!

1. **Code Review:**
   After implementing new code, or after asked to fix a bug, perform a thorough code review. Look for:

   * Hidden or potential bugs
   * Unused or redundant code
   * Overengineered or unnecessarily complex solutions

2. **Playwright Testing:**
   Once the code passes review, use **Playwright mpc** to manually click through the flow ,at http://localhost:3000/, of creating a game, connecting to spotify etc:

   * Follow the process of creating a game step-by-step.
   * Take screenshots during the flow.
   * Monitor the console for warnings or errors.

3. **Bug Fixing and Iteration:**
   If you discover issues, fix them immediately.
   After each fix, redo the clicking around with Playwright and repeat the flow until all issues — even minor ones — are resolved.
